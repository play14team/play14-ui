# ReactJS Development Instructions

Instructions for building high-quality ReactJS applications with modern patterns, hooks, and best practices following the official React documentation at https://react.dev.

## Project Context

- Latest React version (React 19+)
- TypeScript for type safety (when applicable)
- Functional components with hooks as default
- Follow React's official style guide and best practices
- Use modern build tools (Vite, Create React App, or custom Webpack setup)
- Implement proper component composition and reusability patterns

## Development Standards

### Architecture

- Use functional components with hooks as the primary pattern
- Implement component composition over inheritance
- Organize components by feature or domain for scalability
- Separate presentational and container components clearly
- Use custom hooks for reusable stateful logic
- Implement proper component hierarchies with clear data flow

### TypeScript Integration

- Use TypeScript interfaces for props, state, and component definitions
- Define proper types for event handlers and refs
- Implement generic components where appropriate
- Use strict mode in `tsconfig.json` for type safety
- Leverage React's built-in types (`React.FC`, `React.ComponentProps`, etc.)
- Create union types for component variants and states

### Component Design

- Follow the single responsibility principle for components
- Use descriptive and consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper prop validation with TypeScript or PropTypes
- Design components to be testable and reusable
- Keep components small and focused on a single concern
- Use composition patterns (render props, children as functions)

### State Management

- Use `useState` for local component state
- Implement `useReducer` for complex state logic
- Leverage `useContext` for sharing state across component trees
- Consider external state management (Redux Toolkit, Zustand) for complex applications
- Implement proper state normalization and data structures
- Use React Query or SWR for server state management

### Hooks and Effects

- Use `useEffect` with proper dependency arrays to avoid infinite loops
- Implement cleanup functions in effects to prevent memory leaks
- Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` for performance optimization when needed
- Create custom hooks for reusable stateful logic
- Follow the rules of hooks (only call at the top level)
- Use `useRef` for accessing DOM elements and storing mutable values

### Performance Optimization

- Use `React.memo` for component memoization when appropriate
- Implement code splitting with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking and dynamic imports
- Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` judiciously to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implement virtual scrolling for large lists
- Profile components with React DevTools to identify performance bottlenecks

### Error Handling

- Implement Error Boundaries for component-level error handling
- Use proper error states in data fetching
- Implement fallback UI for error scenarios
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Handle async errors in effects and event handlers
- Provide meaningful error messages to users

## Common Patterns

- Higher-Order Components (HOCs) for cross-cutting concerns
- Render props pattern for component composition
- Compound components for related functionality
- Provider pattern for context-based state sharing
- Container/Presentational component separation
- Custom hooks for reusable logic extraction
