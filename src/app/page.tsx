        <p>
          Welcome to #play14, a global movement that believes in the{" "}
          <strong>transformative power of play</strong>!
        </p>
        <p>
          We are a worldwide gathering of like-minded people who believe that{" "}
          <strong>
            playing is the best way to learn, share and get creative!
          </strong>{" "}
          We are a movement started in 2014, we are a{" "}
          <strong>global series of events</strong> organized in different cities
          on <strong>all five continents</strong>, we are an unconference
          following <strong>the principles of open-space technology</strong>,
          but above all we are a family whose members{" "}
          <strong>share common values and interests</strong>.
        </p>
        <h3 className="pt-100 pb-3">Discover the power of play</h3>
        <p>
          Play is a better way to learn because it engages both mind and body,
          making learning an active, immersive experience. Through play,
          individuals explore, experiment, and discover concepts in a hands-on
          way, which enhances understanding and retention. It encourages
          creativity, problem-solving, and collaboration, helping learners
          develop critical thinking skills. Play also reduces stress and
          increases motivation, making the learning process enjoyable and
          effective. By creating a safe space for trial and error, play fosters
          a deeper, more meaningful connection to the material being learned.
