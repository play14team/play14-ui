          Welcome to #play14 (the "Conference" or "we"), an unconference
          organized in different cities around the world. By accessing and using
          our website located at https://play14.org (the "Site") and related
          services (collectively, the "Services"), you (the "User" or "you")
          agree to be bound by these Terms of Service (the "Terms"). If you do
          not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Services.

          <p>
            You must be at least 18 years old to use the Services. If you are

          <h2>2. Tickets and Fees</h2>
          <p>
            The Conference is non-profit, but we sell tickets to cover the
            organization fees. The price of tickets may vary depending on
            various factors, such as the location of the Conference and the time
            of purchase.

          <h2>3. Ticketing System</h2>
          <p>
            To attend an event, you will be requested to buy a ticket through a
            ticketing system (the "Ticketing System"). Each event organizing
            team may setup their own Ticketing System, depending on the country
            or region where the event is organized. The currency, ticket prices
            and fees will be adapted accordingly.

        <div className="pt-5">
          <h2>4. Refund Policy</h2>
          <p>
            By default, all ticket sales are final, and we do not offer refunds
            unless the Conference is cancelled or rescheduled. In such cases, we
            will notify you and provide you with a full refund of the ticket
            price. On a case by case basis, an event organizing team may decide
            to issue refund upon request.
